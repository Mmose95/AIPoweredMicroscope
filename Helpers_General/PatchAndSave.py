""" The purpose of this code is to take large original images and convert them to patches manageable for processing in the following NN (and saving them to a specified folder
 This code is independent of the main and should not be run each time a new training is done. Instead, use the DataLoader to load patches directly. Note: "Dataloader" is implemented directly into each individual training loop"""
